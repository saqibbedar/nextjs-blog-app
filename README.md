# Blog App (Under Development üöß)

Welcome to the Blog App! This is a full stack blog application built using Next.js. The app is currently **under development**, and I am actively working on new features and improvements every day.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notice

Please note that this project is a **work in progress**, and things may change frequently as I continue to add new functionality and enhancements. Once the development is complete, I will provide **detailed documentation** for setting up, using, and contributing to the project.

Feel free to check out the repository and explore the code, but keep in mind that some features might not be fully functional or stable yet.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Development Setup) 

To run the app locally in its current state, follow the instructions below:

   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

    npm Install
    ```

3. Start the development server::

    ```bash
